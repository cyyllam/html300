    <h1>CSS is Cool</h1>

    <p>
      Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.

I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English.

It's not personal. It's business. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. That's my family Kay, that's not me.
